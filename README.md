# mosquito_alert_fast_map_api_docs

This repository is where we generate the simple website that hosts the documentation for the Mosquito Alert Fast Map API. The live version of this documentation is located at the URLs we have generated for various users using the pattern:

http://webserver.mosquitoalert.com/fmapi/{org}/{key}/docs/

The documentation is simply a static html file that we have been transfering manually to episerver for this purpose. The approach here is something that we are now in the process of improving: We will soon have a central metadata web-book with all documentation. We will then find a way to display the relevant parts of this book on the API's documentation site so that it remains in sync with any updates.
